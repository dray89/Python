My Commonly Used Scripts

google.py:
  Scrape a google search filtering for site. Useful for administration tasks involving multiple searches on the same website. For example,     separate searches by company names.
  
mergedocxfiles.py:
  Merge multiple word document files together. Useful for administration tasks requiring editing multiple documents using similar find and replace edits. When pressed for time, I have used this to quickly gather information on the same subject from multiple files using "find" to seek out keywords.
  
EmailMailMerge.py: 
  Perform mail merge using Python and word document as template which updates an excel document based on the outcome.
